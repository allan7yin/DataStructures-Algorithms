# CSES Problem Set - Rust Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) implemented in Rust.

## Running Solutions

Each problem is implemented as a separate binary. To run a specific solution:

```bash
cargo run --bin problem_name
```

For example:
```bash
cargo run --bin weird_algorithm
cargo run --bin missing_number
cargo run --bin repetitions
```

## Project Structure
