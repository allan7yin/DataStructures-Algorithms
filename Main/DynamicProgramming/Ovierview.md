### Introduction

Mathematically, dynamic programming is an optimization method on one or more sequences (e.g., arrays, matrices). So questions asking about the optimal way to do something on one or more sequences are often a good candidate for dynamic programming. Typically, dynamic programming problems will ask for one of the following:

The maximum/longest, minimal/shortest value/cost/profit you can get from doing operations on a sequence.
How many ways there are to do something. This can often be solved by DFS + memoization, i.e., top-down dynamic programming.
Is it possible to accomplish something? Often this kind of problem will ask you to return a boolean.
